<https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/>

1. Register Block in /blocks/register-blocks.php

   1. Be sure to set a good icon.

1. Create ACF field group, set location as Form > Block. Be sure to select "Show in GraphQL". You don't need to se the GraphQL types manually. The default works.
1. Refresh Gutenberg Block cache in menu graphql > gutenberg
1. Verify that new component is available in gutenberg editor or graphiql (note you may need to clear site cache)
1. Create backend PHP template and styles
   1. in /blocks/ dir add new dir for block (eg "/block/slideshow")
   1. add template to `/block/slideshow/block.php`
   1. add styles to `/block/slideshow/block.css`
1. Add GQL to /gql/fragments/GutenbergBlocks.gql query. Be sure to alias your fields with `fields` like so:

```graphql
# Custom Blocks
fragment SlideshowBlock on Block {
  ... on AcfSlideshowBlock {
    # AcfCreditBlock is always like `Acf${BlockName}Block`
    attributes {
      wpClasses: className
    }
    fields: blockSlideshow {
      # blockSlideshow is the ACF field group name
      slides {
        ...MediaImage
      }
    }
  }
}
```

1. Import Component to the WpGutenberg.vue file for lazy loading
1. Build frontend Vue template in `/components/gutenberg`
