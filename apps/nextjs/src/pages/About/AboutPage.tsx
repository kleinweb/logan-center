          Temple University’s Klein College of Media and Communication launched
          the Center for Urban Investigative Reporting in 2022, thanks to a $1.2
          million founding grant from the Jonathan Logan Family Foundation of
          Berkeley, California.

        <span className="span-3 urwdin-regular-normal-black-18px">
          The Jonathan Logan Family Foundation Center for Urban Investigative
          Reporting focuses exclusively on the issues facing Philadelphia and
          other large American cities, including gun violence, economic
          inequality, education and health disparities, crumbling infrastructure
          and eroding trust in institutions. Through the Logan Center, Klein
          students and faculty will report aggressively not only on these
          problems, but on potential solutions, closely examining what has
          worked well in other cities across the nation and the globe.

        Klein has long had a “teaching hospital” model for preparing students
        for careers in journalism and other communications professions, giving
        them a strong foundation in theory and research along with myriad
        opportunities to hone their skills on campus and in the community.
        Through the college’s Philadelphia Neighborhoods capstone class,
        students report from areas of Philadelphia that are largely overlooked
        by mainstream media.
        <br />
        The college has also worked closely with community groups to form news
        and information websites in Kensington and Germantown. Temple University
        Television, housed within Klein, provides student-produced news and
        other public-service programming available on cable systems throughout
        the city.

            “We’re thrilled to be partnering with Temple University’s Klein
            College of Media and Communication to train smart young journalists
            in urban investigative reporting, not only to expose problems but
            also to report on promising solutions that can really make a
            difference in people’s lives. Dean David Boardman and I have known
            one another for more than forty years. His leadership in newsrooms
            has been brilliant, and his reputation in the field of investigative
            journalism is unparalleled. He and his team at Temple share our
            commitment to equity and inclusion in journalism. They have built a
            great program and I know they have what it takes to make this new
            program impactful and successful.”

        Now, Klein students will have more resources to dig beneath the surface
        of the city’s stories. At the same time, said Klein Dean David Boardman,
        the Logan Center will aim to redefine investigative reporting so that it
        is more equitable, inclusive, community-focused and solutions-oriented.
        <br />
        “Through this generous grant, our students will not only graduate with
        impressive investigative skills, they will be producing important work
        while they learn,” said Boardman, a former president of the
        Investigative Reporters and Editors international organization.
        <br />
        That work, Boardman said, will appear not only on Temple sites, but also
        in local publications large and small through new partnerships. The
        college will be hiring two experienced journalists to teach and work
        side-by-side with students.

            Klein’s vision is to shape media and media-creators through a
            dynamic combination of academic rigor and practical training in the
            context of a diverse urban media market.
            <br />
            Klein fosters media solutions, innovation and discourse through its
            faculty, composed of both world-class scholars and renowned
            practitioners. With this variety of thought coursing through the
            college, discussions are at the cutting edge of the ever-changing
            communication industry. Located in the heart of Philadelphia,
            faculty and students are able to directly apply this knowledge to
            one of the nation’s largest media communities.
            <br />
            Klein aims to educate students to be ethical, critical and inventive
            leaders, producers and citizens in a multimedia and multicultural
            society. When Klein students graduate, they have not only acquired a
            variety of skills and abilities, but have become discerners of truth
            and meaning prepared to bring precision and creativity into the
            workplace.
