monitor and control all uses of its trademarks. Unauthorized use of Temple
trademarks is subject to civil and criminal penalties. Temple reserves the right
to take appropriate action when confronted with unauthorized use of its
trademarks. Such actions may include confiscation of the goods, financial
penalties and legal action.

Temple requires that all individuals, organizations, departments and companies,
both internal and external, obtain prior approval before producing any
product(s) that will display the university’s trademarks, regardless of the
method of distribution.

## Trademarks

A Temple trademark is any mark, logo, symbol, nickname, letter(s), word or
derivative associated with Temple University and distinguished from those of
other institutions or entities.

Temple has both graphical trademarks and verbiage registered with the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office. The graphical trademarks are those commonly called
“logos” and include the words TEMPLE, Temple University Owls; and logos such as
the stylized Temple “T,” the Owl Head and the Owl Eyes, among others. Also
trademarked are the official Temple University seal, which is for executive use
only and requires pre-approval for exceptions.

## Trademark Usage

Temple trademarks may not be altered in any way. Temple trademarks may not be
used in any manner that suggests or implies Temple's endorsement of other
organizations, companies, products, services, political parties or views, or
religious organizations or beliefs.

Temple's trademarks may not be used in any way that discriminates or implies
discrimination against any persons or groups based on age, ancestry, belief,
color, creed, disability, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, veteran status, or in any other way that would be a violation of
Temple's anti-discrimination policies or practices.

No one other than Temple may claim copyright or trademark rights or seek to
register any design that uses Temple trademarks.

Any person, organization or business wishing to use Temple’s name, logos, marks,
indicia or verbiage on any product, video, advertisements or for any other
commercial purpose must have a license prior to production and distribution.
This includes businesses that sell to university departments, campus
organizations, and student organizations that use the product for fundraising

seeking additional approval.

## Exemptions

Certain uses of Temple’s trademarks do not require prior approval from Temple's

of the Temple name or other trademarks in connection with news reporting and
other fair uses that do not undermine Temple’s rights to its trademarks. Temple
departments, groups, and registered student organizations may not assign rights
to or otherwise grant permission to any other entity for use of Temple
trademarks for any purpose without prior review and approval by Temple’s Office
of Business Services. Stationery products can be ordered through Staples
Business Solutions (TUmarketplace), and it is recommended that Temple’s in-house
