## Managing The Frontend (Next.js)

### Dev Server

From the root of this project, run the following command to start the Next.js development server on <http://localhost:3000>

```bash
npm run dev
```

> Note: Make sure Docker is running first, otherwise Next.js wont be able to query any data.

---

### Linting

Regularly linting the codebase is highly encouraged (and is enforced via pre-commit hook) to ensure code quality and consistency.

```bash
npm run lint
```

---

### Run a Production Build

It's often helpful to run a production build locally to verify everything works before deploying. To run a production build, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build && npm run start
```

---

### Image Optimization

Next.js supports [image optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization) out of the box. To use it, you can import the `Image` component from `next/image` and pass it the URL of the image you want to optimize, including images from WordPress.

In order to use [Remote Images](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization#remote-images), you'll need to update the list of hostnames in `next.config.js`.

For example, if you're loading remote images from `unsplash.com`:

```js
// next.config.js
images: {
  remotePatterns: [
    {
      protocol: 'https',
      hostname: '**.unsplash.com',
    },
  ]
}
```

---

### On-Demand Revalidation

Next.js supports [on-demand revalidation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/overview#on-demand-revalidation). This means that if a post or page is updated in WordPress, then WordPress will ping the frontend and tell Next.js to re-generate that post or page in the background. The next visitor to that page will see the updated content.

If your site has a lot of traffic, this option provides the best user experience and prevents your WordPress server from becoming overwhelmed, since content will remain static until it has been updated.

To view the code for this feature, check out the [frontend](https://github.com/gregrickaby/nextjs-wordpress/blob/main/pages/api/wordpress/revalidate.ts) and [backend](https://github.com/gregrickaby/nextjs-wordpress-plugin/blob/main/inc/revalidation.php) repositories.

---

### Disable Static Site Generation (SSG)

If your WordPress install has hundreds or even thousands of pages and posts, it will take a long time to generate a static site at build time. Additionally, WP GraphQL caps the number of requests to 100, so querying more than that will likely overwhelm your server[[1]](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/nextjs-wordpress-starter/issues/1008#issue-1228084495).

Instead, you can [generate paths on-demand](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-paths#generating-paths-on-demand). This means pages and posts will be server-side rendered first, then cached, and then served statically for the next visitor. This is a good compromise for sites with a lot of content.

To disable static site generation, set the `DISABLE_STATIC_SITE_GENERATION` environment variable in `.env.local` to `true`:

```text
// .env.local
DISABLE_STATIC_SITE_GENERATION="true"
```

---

### Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

Next.js supports [ISR](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/overview#incremental-static-regeneration) for pages that use `getStaticProps`. This means Next.js will re-generate a page or post in the background and serve the updated page to the next user.

If you open `pages/[...slug].js` and look at the `getStaticProps` function, you'll see that it has a `revalidate` property set to `false`. That's because this project uses [on-demand revalidation](#on-demand-revalidation) instead of ISR. If you want to use ISR, you can set `revalidate` to a number of seconds. For example, to re-generate a page or post every 60 seconds, set `revalidate` to `60`.

> In my experience, ISR has the potential to overwhelm your server if you have a large site with a lot of traffic[[2]](https://web.archive.org/web/20220928131746/https://webdevstudios.com/2021/03/09/next-js-headless-wordpress/). This is because pages/posts will be constantly querying WordPress in the background.

---

### Redirects

Next.js supports [redirects](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/redirects). If you change the slug of a page or post, you can add a redirect to `next.config.js` redirect visitors to the new URL.

The current redirect forwards visitors from the `/homepage` path to the actual homepage:

```js
// next.config.js
async redirects() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/homepage',
      destination: '/',
      permanent: true
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Reactions

Post reactions are supported. Simply click a "like", "dislike", or "love" icon on a blog post and you'll see the number increase.

Reactions are saved in the WordPress database as post meta, and can be easily edited in the "Post Fields" section under the WordPress block editor:

![screenshot of post meta under the block editor](https://ucbfc2fffdb69e5a814489571532.previews.dropboxusercontent.com/p/thumb/ABoi5nGMV4GKqD09UqbD1bNAvv3qDEFaWKcvKRTzWASXZQUXYNsXYFXzAT5T7_FOFa5T0g8XAAvuOsXdglcxw5_HO_bvnDL7Y-PKkzCw19MdWaQTx14enjbJVuytswtYJtKnEgqTqQNAlQSx2o53ic5ffDrLyjMgP3dPo-qhogEo_1SAuGV-YLVt6bYJt40W-t0KbqK64rMn1DrTgkGAtGHzahwLWJITWp_LFvy_RJ_rPE2YQ2hp3hJdns-7GZBTfupptloQkGCfOS7_kn34VkgTMEXDq603w85GkvcQa1DNNGHsK9RjQQTaBasBNvRBA_-Ky06heej4m_ceQzAGfplWFiDXq1vJDr-6fJoOfVUOCsH6ym2zMF_0rBTHRTWfF8zSgTw1XhY9bltmoT9KtJsp/p.png)

## Managing The Backend (WordPress)

### Headless Plugin & Theme

There is a WordPress [plugin](https://github.com/gregrickaby/nextjs-wordpress-plugin) and [theme](https://github.com/gregrickaby/nextjs-wordpress-theme) that help support turing WordPress into a headless CMS.

By design, these helpers are lightweight and use old-school functional programming to keep things simple. If you need more robust functionality, please check out [Faust.js](https://faustjs.org/).

They're both managed with Composer, so you can update them by running the following command from the `/backend` directory:

```bash
composer upgrade
```

Contributions to the plugin and theme are welcome!

---

### Page/Post Previews

Previewing pages and posts is supported. Simply click "preview" in the WordPress admin and you'll be taken to the frontend where you can see a preview.

---

### Comments

Comments, Gravatars, nested comments, and comment moderation are all supported.

> Note: Comments are held for moderation by default. You can change this in the WordPress admin under "Settings" > "Discussion".

---

### GraphQL

GraphQL endpoint: `https://nextjswp.test/graphql`

GraphiQL IDE: <https://nextjswp.test/wp-admin/admin.php?page=graphiql-ide>

---

### WordPress Constants

Inside `docker-compose.yml` there are several developer friendly constants you can enable to help with debugging. Feel free to add, remove, or change these values as needed.

```yml
# docker-compose.yml
WORDPRESS_DEBUG: 1 # Set to 0 to disable `WP_DEBUG`
WORDPRESS_CONFIG_EXTRA: |
  define('WP_CACHE', false);
  define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);
  define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
  define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '256M');
  define('WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE', 'development');
  define('HEADLESS_FRONTEND_URL', '${HEADLESS_FRONTEND_URL}');
  define('PREVIEW_SECRET_TOKEN', '${PREVIEW_SECRET_TOKEN}');
  define('WP_SITEURL', 'https://${WORDPRESS_URL}');
  define('WP_HOME', 'https://${WORDPRESS_URL}');
```

> If you change the default values, run `docker-compose up -d` to rebuild the containers.

---

### WP CLI

[WP-CLI](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/) is a command line interface for WordPress. It's a tool that makes it easy to manage WordPress sites.

First, tunnel into the `wpcli` container:

```bash
docker exec -it nextjs-wordpress-wpcli-1 /bin/sh
```

Now you can run WP-CLI commands against your WordPress installation.

For example:

```bash
wp --info
```

Will return:

```bash
OS:     Linux 5.10.124-linuxkit #1 SMP PREEMPT Thu Jun 30 08:18:26 UTC 2022 aarch64
Shell:
PHP binary:     /usr/local/bin/php

```

See the full list of WP-CLI commands at: <https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/>

---

### Composer

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is a dependency manager for PHP. It makes it easy to manage your project's dependencies.

First, tunnel into the `composer` container:

```bash
docker exec -it nextjs-wordpress-composer-1 /bin/sh
```

Now you can run Composer from inside the container.

For example, to validate the `composer.json`:

```bash
composer validate
```

Will return:

```bash
./composer.json is valid
```
